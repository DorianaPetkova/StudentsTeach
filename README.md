        <h2>Overview:</h2>
        <p>StudentsTeach is a dynamic web application, created for everyone who is tired of asking their friend to explain them the material 10 minutes before a test. With StudentsTeach, it’s in the name, students can find each other and explain various themes in an easy way, because who better than a peer to explain something to you? Our application gives people a chance to connect and form friendships through learning and development.</p>
        <p>The idea came because of one horrible math test. We decided to create StudentsTeach because we wanted to give our classmates an opportunity to learn easily and quickly while still having fun.</p>
